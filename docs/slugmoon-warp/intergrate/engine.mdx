# Engine Integration

In this section, we will cover how to integrate <span className="emoji-like-icon"><img src="/img/icon.png" alt="Slugmoon Emblem" /></span> <GradientText animated>Slugmoon Warp</GradientText> into your game engine. This allows you to perform actions like d-join lock, where they can only join via <span className="emoji-like-icon"><img src="/img/icon.png" alt="Slugmoon Emblem" /></span> <GradientText animated>Slugmoon Warp</GradientText>!

:::
Place the folder you downloaded in the `ServerScriptService` of your game, then configure the settings in the `ModuleScript` inside the folder to your liking.

- **Require the Slugmoon Warp Game Engine**: In your roblox game, you can require the Slugmoon Warp Game Engine by using the following code snippet:
```lua title="ModuleScript in ServerScriptService"
--[[
    Slugmoon Warp Game Engine
    This module allows you to integrate Slugmoon Warp into your game.
    Make sure to require this module in your Module Script.
]]--

require(112993552440807)

return {
	whitelist = function(player: Player)
		if player:GetRankInGroup(game.CreatorId) >= 24 then
			return true
		else
			return false
		end
	end
}
```
Configure the `whitelist` function to your liking, it is used to determine whitelists for <span className="emoji-like-icon"><img src="/img/icon.png" alt="Slugmoon Emblem" /></span> <GradientText animated>Slugmoon Warp</GradientText> commands in your game.

## Using the Slugmoon Warp Game Engine
Once you have added the Slugmoon Warp Game Engine to your game, you can use it to perform various actions such as d-join lock, where players can only join via <span className="emoji-like-icon"><img src="/img/icon.png" alt="Slugmoon Emblem" /></span> <GradientText animated>Slugmoon Warp</GradientText>.

Whitleisted players can use the following commands in your game:

<details>
  <summary>Who are whitelisted players?</summary>

 Whitelisted players are players that, when put through the `whitelist` function, return `true`. This means that they are allowed to use the Slugmoon Warp Game Engine commands in your game. You can customize the `whitelist` function to determine which players are whitelisted based on their rank in the group or any other criteria you choose.
</details>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Disable direct join" default>
    Say `!djoin off` in your game to disable direct joining. This will prevent players from joining your game directly and will require them to use <span className="emoji-like-icon"><img src="/img/icon.png" alt="Slugmoon Emblem" /></span> <GradientText animated>Slugmoon Warp</GradientText> to join.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Enable direct join">
  :::info
  Direct joining is on by default, so you don't need to enable it unless you have disabled it via `!djoin off`.

  You can enable it by default by changing the source code of the Slugmoon Warp Game Engine. (there will be something like `djoinEnabled = false` in the source code, change it to `djoinEnabled = true` soon.)
  :::
    Say `!djoin on` in your game to enable direct joining. This will allow players to join your game directly without using <span className="emoji-like-icon"><img src="/img/icon.png" alt="Slugmoon Emblem" /></span> <GradientText animated>Slugmoon Warp</GradientText>.
